# blogsite
Example blog site powered by Django and Bootstrap.

## Uses
This project was created to help those, who are otherwise unfamiliar, get started with Django. It uses PostgresSQL as the backend database, but Django projects are created using Sqlite out-of-the-box. This site just uses Bootstrap for styling to keep things simple, but feel free to style it however you like.
